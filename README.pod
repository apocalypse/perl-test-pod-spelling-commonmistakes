Test::Pod::Spelling::CommonMistakes - Checks POD for common spelling mistakes

=head1 VERSION

  This document describes v1.001 of Test::Pod::Spelling::CommonMistakes - released October 31, 2014 as part of Test-Pod-Spelling-CommonMistakes.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

	#!/usr/bin/perl
	use strict; use warnings;

	use Test::More;

	eval "use Test::Pod::Spelling::CommonMistakes";
	if ( $@ ) {
		plan skip_all => 'Test::Pod::Spelling::CommonMistakes required for testing POD';
	} else {
		all_pod_files_ok();
	}

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module checks your POD for common spelling errors. This differs from L<Test::Spelling> because it doesn't use your system spellchecker
and instead uses L<Pod::Spell::CommonMistakes> for the heavy lifting. Using it is the same as any standard Test::* module, as seen here.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 all_pod_files_ok( [ @files ] )

This function is what you will usually run. It automatically finds any POD in your distribution and runs checks on them.

Accepts an optional argument: an array of files to check. By default it checks all POD files it can find in the distribution. Every file it finds
is passed to the C<pod_file_ok()> function.

=head2 pod_file_ok( $file, [ $name ] )

C<pod_file_ok()> will okay the test if there is spelling errors present in the POD. Furthermore, if the POD was
malformed as reported by L<Pod::Simple>, the test will fail and not attempt to check spelling.

When it fails, C<pod_file_ok()> will show any misspelled words and their suggested spelling as diagnostics.

The optional second argument $name is the name of the test.  If it is omitted, C<pod_file_ok()> chooses a default
test name "Spelling test for $file".

=head1 EXPORT

Automatically exports the two subs.
